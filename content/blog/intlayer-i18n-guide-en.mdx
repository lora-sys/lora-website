# Why I Chose Intlayer Over Next.js Native i18n: A Full-Stack Internationalization Guide

When building multi-language web applications, internationalization (i18n) is often a headache. While Next.js provides native i18n support, it can feel a bit limited in real-world development, especially when aiming for ultimate Developer Experience (DX) and type safety.

Today, I want to share why I chose **Intlayer** for my personal project [loralg](https://github.com/lora-sys/lora-website) and how to perfectly integrate it with Cloudflare.

## 1. Intlayer vs. Next.js Native i18n

### Pain Points of Next.js Native i18n
Next.js native i18n primarily focuses on **Routing**. It helps you handle paths like `/en/about` or `/zh/about`, but for **Content Management**, you usually need to:
- Manually maintain huge JSON dictionary files.
- Manually write Middleware to detect language preferences.
- Lack out-of-the-box type safety, making it easy to make mistakes with key names.
- Content is separated from components, requiring frequent file switching during development.

### Advantages of Intlayer
**Intlayer** adopts a more modern, developer-intuitive approach:

1.  **Content Co-location**: You can define translation content in `*.content.ts` files and place them in the corresponding component directory. No more searching through a massive `zh.json`.
2.  **Automatic Type Safety**: Intlayer automatically generates TypeScript types based on your content definitions. If you change a key name, your IDE will immediately flag the error.
3.  **Declarative Configuration**: Manage language settings through `intlayer.config.ts` with extreme simplicity.
4.  **Seamless App Router Integration**: Fully supports both Server and Client Components.

## 2. Configuration in Practice

In my project, Intlayer integration is straightforward.

### Core Configuration: `intlayer.config.ts`
We just need to define supported and default locales:

```typescript
import { Locales, type IntlayerConfig } from "intlayer";

const config: IntlayerConfig = {
  internationalization: {
    locales: [Locales.ENGLISH, Locales.CHINESE],
    defaultLocale: Locales.ENGLISH,
  },
};

export default config;
```

### Defining Translation Content
Taking the `Hero` component as an example, we define content in [hero.content.ts](file:///Users/loralora/repos/loralg/components/section/hero.content.ts):

```typescript
import { t, type Dictionary } from "intlayer";

const heroContent = {
  key: "hero",
  content: {
    typingText: t({
      en: ["Hi, I'm lora", "I build things for the web"],
      zh: ["你好，我是 lora", "我为 Web 构建应用"],
    }),
    // ... other content
  },
} satisfies Dictionary;

export default heroContent;
```

### Using in Components
In [hero.tsx](file:///Users/loralora/repos/loralg/components/section/hero.tsx), you can get type-safe content via the `useIntlayer` hook:

```tsx
"use client";
import { useIntlayer } from "react-intlayer";

export function HeroSection() {
  const { typingText } = useIntlayer("hero");
  return <h1>{typingText.value[0]}</h1>;
}
```

## 3. Going to Production: Cloudflare & OpenNext

Deploying a Next.js project to Cloudflare Workers/Pages can be challenging because Next.js is designed for Node.js environments. To achieve this, we use **OpenNext** (via `@opennextjs/cloudflare`).

### Deployment Workflow
1.  **Build Dictionaries**: Run `intlayer build` to generate JSON and type definitions.
2.  **Adapt for Cloudflare**: Run `opennextjs-cloudflare build`. This step converts Next.js build outputs into Cloudflare Workers compatible format.
3.  **Deploy**: Use `wrangler deploy` to push to Cloudflare.

In `package.json`, our build scripts look like this:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build:cf": "intlayer build && opennextjs-cloudflare build",
    "deploy:cf": "wrangler deploy"
  }
}
```

### Why Cloudflare?
- **Extreme Edge Performance**: Global distribution with millisecond response times.
- **Low Cost**: Cloudflare's Workers plans are very friendly for individual developers compared to Vercel.
- **Perfect i18n Support**: Combined with Intlayer's static content generation, most translations are ready at the edge with almost zero performance overhead.

## Conclusion

Intlayer has changed the way I handle internationalization. It not only improves development efficiency but, more importantly, keeps the codebase clean and maintainable. If you're building multi-language apps with Next.js, I highly recommend giving Intlayer a try.
